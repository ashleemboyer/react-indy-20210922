# Build a Dark & Light Mode Switcher in React using Context @ React.Indy on September 22nd, 2021

## About the Talk

Do you find yourself impressed but intimidated by dark/light mode switchers? Curious about the React Context API but not sure where to start? In this live-coding session we'll build a theme switcher that covers creating a Context from scratch and exposing its value with a hook, persisting the theme across browser sessions using local storage, and setting the default theme based on OS settings. We'll also be doing it in TypeScript!
